# QbitWebUI

An alternative Web Interface to the original [qBittorrent Web UI](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent). This interface is very slimmed down and contains the following features

* Adding torrents
* Deleting torrents
* Searching by name
* Bulk edit (pause, resume, delete)
* Sorting by different metrics (name, size, etc.)
* File System Navigation (easily choose where to save a torrent)
* A fully material-themed UI (Light & Dark themes)
* ... More to come!

## Configuration
This app relies on a couple files to work properly. This app also requires **API v4** or higher to function properly.

### HTTP_Config
Under `src/assets/` there are two files: `http_config.json` and `http_config.prod.json`. During the production build, the former is replaced with the latter file. 

If you wish to configure your endpoints and other data for dev/prod, do so here.

### General Config
Under `src/assets/` there are two files: `config.json` and `config.prod.json`. This will store general configuration, such as the delimeter used when parsing file paths (Unix vs. Windows).

## Running the App -- Development server
To install the dependencies, run `npm install` in both the root directory and the `mock_backend/` folder.

### Front-end:
1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

### Back-end
1. Navigate to `mock_backend/` directory (`cd mock_backend`)
2. Run `node index.js`

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the Angular source code.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Replacing existing qBittorrent Web UI
In order to use this version, first follow the instructions outlined [here (*)](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Alternate-WebUI-usage).

Once you've completed that:

1. Build the production app (from build section)
2. Navigate to the `dist/` directory, and copy all files to your clipboard
3. Navigate to wherever you placed the `public`/`private` folder from (*)
4. Replace all the contents of the `private` folder with the contents of `dist/` from the project directoy

Alternatively, you can take a production-ready build from the `builds` directory in this project. The latest version is zipped.

## Screenshots
The following are some snippets from the alternate UI. They may (or may not) be outdated. To get the best idea of where the app currently is, consider running it locally.
